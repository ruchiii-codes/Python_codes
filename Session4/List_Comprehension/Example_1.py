# Add 1 to 10 numbers to a list
L = [i for i in range(1, 11)]  # List comprehension to create a list of numbers from 1 to 10
print(L)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]



# This is a simple way 
L = []
for i in range(1,11):
    L.append(i)  # Append each number from 1 to 10 to the list L
print(L)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
