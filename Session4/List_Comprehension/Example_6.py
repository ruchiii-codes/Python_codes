# Nested if with List Comprehension
basket = ['apple','guava','cherry','banana']
my_fruits = ['apple','kiwi','grapes','banana']

# add new list from my_fruits and items if the fruit exists in basket and also starts with 'a'

List = [fruit for fruit in my_fruits if fruit in basket if fruit.startswith('a')]
print(List)  # Output: ['apple']
