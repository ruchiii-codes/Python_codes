#Program - The current population of a town is 10000. The population of the town is increasing at the rate of 10% per year. 
#You have to write a program to find out the population at the end of each of the last 10 years.

curr_pop = 10000

for year in range (10,0,-1):
    print(year, curr_pop)
    curr_pop = curr_pop / 1.1

#Population in 9th year = x 
#x + x of 10% = 10000
#x + 0.1x = 10000
#x(1 + 0.1) = 10000
#x = 10000 / 1.1
